-Game currently doesn't stop if you hit 2048(no win notification)

-Game does know when you have lost but at the moment it immediately goes back to menu
  -Possibly have a popup window when you lose that allows mouse input to either quit the program
    or try again
    
-Add in a way to keep track of score? use w/e you would like to count as "points" 
  -Tiles combining, Moves made? w/e floats your boat
  
-Maybe keep track of highscores along with previous idea,  could possibly have a text file attached
  -which is loaded off of when game starts and written over when we are ending
  
-Graphics could be improved upon if anyone wants to figure out how we would

These are just a few ideas, add whatever you would like

ONLY commit to github if code compiles and works(if there are bugs they aren't game breaking
  and can be fixed later)
